# Scious Search [Latest]

The following is documentation for the latest version of the Scious Search plugin - version `0.2.0`. Scious is prouncounced **sci** like **sci**ence and **us** like _you and I_.

# Features

**Scious Search** makes it possible to build real time, search-as-you-type experiences in Bubble. As a deep integration, it:

- Preserves Bubble privacy settings across all data types.
- Provides a live and a test version of your search database.
- Does not degrade or slow down as your database grows since it uses [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) or [Typesense](https://cloud.typesense.org/bubble) as a search provider.
- Can sort search results by options.
- Allows you to easily swap and experiment with other search providers.

## Getting started

All first time Scious Search users get a 2 day free trial but you can visit [scious-plugins.bubbleapps.io/scious-search](https://scious-plugins.bubbleapps.io/scious-search) to try it before you buy it. For guidance you can always refer to the demo's editor which self documents exactly how to provide your end users with a search as you type experience (assuming you're already setup as shown below). If all else fails, please try for help on the forum.
