# Scious Search [Latest]

The following is documentation for the latest version of the Scious Search plugin - version `0.2.0`. Scious: prouncounced **sci** like **sci**ence and **us** like _you and I_.

# Features

**Scious Search** makes it possible to build real time, search-as-you-type experiences in Bubble. As a deep integration, it also:

- Preserves Bubble privacy settings across all data types.
- Provides a live and a test version of your search database.
- Does not degrade or slow down as your database grows since it uses [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) or [Typesense](https://cloud.typesense.org/bubble) as a search provider.
- Can sort search results by options.
- Allows you to easily swap and experiment with other search providers.

## Getting started

### Creating your end user's white-labelling experience

The Scious Search [Demo](https://scious-plugins.bubbleapps.io/scious-search) shows a few ways you can implement an end user search-as-you-type experience:

Ultimately the look and feel is up to you but an implementation should achieve the following:

1. Provision a white-label on your Netlify account.
2. Link your customer's unique Bubble URL to their provisioned white-label.
3. Provide your customer with appropriate A or CNAME records for them to add in their DNS provider.
4. HTTPS secure the white-label
5. Update a white-label
6. Delete a white-label

Let's take a look at how each of these are implemented in TheirLabel's Test Drive (learn it quicker by following along in the editor).
