# Scious Search [Latest]

The following is documentation for the latest version of the Scious Search plugin - version `0.2.0`.

# Features

**Scious Search** makes it possible to build real time, search-as-you-type experiences in Bubble. As a deep integration, it:

- Preserves Bubble privacy settings across all data types.
- Provides a live and a test version of your search database.
- Does not degrade or slow down as your database grows since it uses [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) or [Typesense](https://cloud.typesense.org/bubble) as a search provider.
- Can sort search results by options.
- Allows you to easily swap and experiment with other search providers.

## Getting started

First time users get a 2 day free trial to experiment with Scious Search but you can also [visit our demo](https://scious-plugins.bubbleapps.io/scious-search) to try it before you buy. Additionally, [the demo's editor](https://bubble.io/page?type=page&name=scious-search&id=scious-plugins&tab=tabs-1) is an excellent reference while integrating our plugin.

That said, we just need a few things to start searching records in your Bubble app:

## install plugin

- Get your Search Provider's API keys
  - Typesense API keys
  - Get your Algolia API keys
- Setup the Scious Search plugin
- get typesense APi keys
- sync your database
- implement search
