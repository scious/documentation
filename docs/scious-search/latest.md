# Scious Search [Latest]

The following is documentation for the latest version of the Scious Search plugin - `version 0.2.0`.

# Features

**Scious Search** makes it possible to build real time, search-as-you-type experiences in Bubble. As a deep integration, it:

- Preserves Bubble privacy settings across all data types.
- Works with live, test, and other versions of your app so you can thoroughly test your integration before going live.
- Does not degrade or slow down as your database grows since it uses [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) or [Typesense](https://cloud.typesense.org/bubble) as a search provider.
- Can sort search results by options.
- Allows you to easily swap and experiment with other search providers.
