# Scious Search Service Level Agreement

Scious Inc., hereafter reffered to as the Company, will provide Technical Responses to Service Requests received from the Customer. The time allocated to the delivery of Technical Responses shall be measured from the time of receipt of the relevant Service Request by the Company during Support Hours. Upon receipt of a Service Request, the Service Request will be assigned a **Priority**, where the Priority measures the severity of the situation. The "Technical Response Time" will depend on the Priority as follows:

## Priority

### High

**Definition** A key function or feature of the Service is inoperable and further operation cannot proceed until it is fixed.

**Remediation** Provide correction or workaround, as applicable within 4 business hours.

### Medium

**Definition** While a function of the Service is operable, the operation is inconsistent with the Service Levels and the inconsistency involves a material failure to comply with specifications for the same.

**Remediation** Provide correction or workaround, as applicable within 24 hours

### Low

**Definition** An issue which does not affect the functionality of the Service.

**Remediation** Provide correction or workaround, if applicable within 5 days

If Company does not provide a workaround or a correction in the allotted Technical Response Time for a Category 1, 2 or 3 Service Request, Company will continue to work to correct the issue each day during the week for a Category 1 issue or during business hours for a Category 2 or 3 issue.

## Support hours

## Exceptions

Company will not be responsible for correcting a Service Request arising from any of the following:

    * Problems resulting from any modifications of the Service made by any party other than Company.
    * Problems resulting from any Customer Service-Compatible Application(s).
    * Incorrect use of the Service; or to the extent the relevant environment is not within Company’s control.
