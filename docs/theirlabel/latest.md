# TheirLabel [Latest]

[Bubble](https://bubble.io?ref=i61dryk2) is a technology we at Scious have come to love. The ethos behind its creation - that you shouldn't have to have a PhD in computer science to build a custom website - is exciting, democratic, and empowering. There's a lot of great design in this product. To list a few, we're really impressed by the automatically provisioned API one gets the second after you create a new app. Its built in authentication and rule based permissioning is a breeze to work with. Want to change the name of a key in your database? Okay, that key name has been automatically updated across the 56 places you've used it in your application logic! Want to secure your site? Press a button and it's done. All of these things, and many others, crush the core hurdles that stop even seasoned programmers from making sophisticated websites.

For all the niceties, though, every tool has its flaws. One thing Bubble (currently) lacks is a programmatic way to partition multi-tenant apps across different domain names. For many Bubble users this may not be an issue, but for those with dreams of building SaaS applications, it's a bit of a thorn. Being one such dreamer, we decided try to fill this gap. As a result, we bring you **TheirLabel**.

## Getting started

This page serves as the official manual for using TheirLabel. You can visit [their-label.bubbleapps.io](https://their-label.bubbleapps.io) to try it before you buy it. For guidance you can always refer to [TheirLabel's editor](https://bubble.io/page?type=page&name=index&id=their-label&tab=tabs-1) which self documents exactly how to provide your end users with a white-labelling flow (assuming you're already setup as shown below). If all else fails, please try for help on the forum.

### Creating your end user's white-labelling experience

Ultimately the look and feel is up to you but an implementation should achieve the following:

1. Provision a white-label on your Netlify account.
2. Link your customer's unique Bubble URL to their provisioned white-label.
3. Provide your customer with appropriate A or CNAME records for them to add in their DNS provider.
4. HTTPS secure the white-label
5. Update a white-label
6. Delete a white-label

Let's take a look at how each of these are implemented in TheirLabel's Test Drive (learn it quicker by following along in the editor).
