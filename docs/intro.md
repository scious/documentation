## Versioning

We publish documentation for the last three versions of any product to keep these docs consice but can offer support and archived documentation for older versions.

## Support

We offer additional support for all our products through the following channels:

- Forum based support. This is free and we always reply to unanswered questions. While we're usually able to follow up within 2 to 5 business days, sometimes we do take longer. Below are the official support forums for each of our products:
  - [TheirLabel](https://forum.bubble.io/t/introducing-theirlabel-domain-name-white-labeling-for-bubble/104972/last)
- For those with immediate needs, we offer one-on-one sessions to help answer your questions in a guarenteed timeframe. Click here to book a session.
